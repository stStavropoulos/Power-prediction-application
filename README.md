# Prediction model for power generation of a wind turbine

The purpose of this project was to create a Machine Learning model for the prediction of the power generation from a specific wind turbine on a location with known weather conditions. The steps I followed:

1)Acquisition of the files containing the data regarding the wind turbine's function and the location's weather.

2)Data processing with the utilisation of Python's libraries (Pandas, seaborn, matplotlib).

3)Data interpretation and feature engineering.

4)Running multiple machine learning algorithms to choose the best model for the prediction.

5)Creating the required files to develop the application (app.py, requirements.txt, procfile, HTML file).

6)Deployment of the application with Heroku.

# Deployment 

The process I followed to implement the application was:

1)I placed all the files mentioned above to a document .

2)I created a new virtual environment with anaconda prompt.

3)I installed the required packages using $pip install <package> command and run the app.py file with the python app.py command.

4)I wrote pip freeze > requirements.txt command to create the requirements file.

5)I uploaded the files on github and linked it with my Heroku account.

6)I implemented the application on Heroku.


That's it!
